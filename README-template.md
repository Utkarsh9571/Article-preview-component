- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

with this one i started java projects. at start like every other thing its very confusing, one major reason is that i thought to code the java section with watching some youtuber doing that, but later realized that's not how you do it, then need to take the help from Gemini, at first it also wrote and explained in tough way then it made it simple or say for beginer, thn i understand,

how to give values to all necessary classed and ids, and how to think to solve a problem, just need to work a little bit and it will come around.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
